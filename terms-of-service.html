                <h5 style="color: #1acc8d;">Overview</h5>
                  <p>
                    By using the RuBaRu web site and decentralized application (the "Site" and "DApp"), you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions ("Terms of Service").
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    RuBaRu provides a fully on-chain decentralized content creator-consumer economy, featuring content creation, storage, and notification features, to be managed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) once established. Until the DAO is operational, the founding team is responsible for managing and operating RuBaRu based on its core principles. The Site and DApp offer tools and resources for integrating content and managing interactions within the platform (the "Service").
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    RuBaRu reserves the right to update and change the Terms of Service from time to time without notice. Any new features that enhance the Site, including the release of new tools and resources related to the Service, shall be subject to the Terms of Service. Continued use of the Service after any changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. RuBaRu makes no representation or warranty that any information provided, regardless of its source (the "Content"), is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Violation of any of the terms below will result in the suspension/termination of your account based on rules and regulation set by DAO members. While RuBaRu prohibits illegal conduct and Content on the Site, you understand and agree that RuBaRu cannot be responsible for the Content posted on the Site and you may be exposed to such materials. You agree to use the Site and Service at your own risk.
                  </p>
